"""Deterministic source-text chunking for the structured_v2 pipeline.

Structured extraction never hands a whole novel or screenplay to one model
call.  It splits the imported text along boundaries the format already provides
— scene headings for screenplays, chapter markers for prose — and analyses each
piece independently so that work is bounded, parallelisable and resumable.

Every chunk carries the character offsets it came from.  That is what lets a
later extraction prove an entity is real: the evidence it reports has to appear
inside the span it claims, in the imported text, or the candidate is dropped.

Offsets are recovered without changing the shared parsers.  ``parse_scene_blocks``
runs on stripped, blank-filtered lines and cannot report positions in the
original text, and it is used by asset compilation, screenplay normalization and
import quality checks — so instead of altering it, scene headers are located by
scanning forward from the previous block's end.  Blocks come back in source
order, so a forward-only scan cannot match an earlier occurrence.
